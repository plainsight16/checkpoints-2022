## January

- got my foot ripped out by stepping on a nail, LOL
- completed space tourism website...finally
- getting started with mark-down
- getting started with technical writing
- got into alx software engineering bootcamp
- wrote a few java codes here and there on the topics (process scheduling in OS , and concurrency in java)
- school is really pressing hard, so not much as been going on coding development wise which is ironic because i am infact a computer science student. LOL
- wrote my first article. Its titled "A guide to writing better comments". Here's a link -


## February

- Joined ALX
- ALX is a whole lot, deadlines to meetup
-  (I apologize for the few contents and gaps, I'm actually filling this in April...LOL)
- (I really don't use "LOL", absolutely abhor it but can't seem to figure out how to do emojis on markdown.)
- Wrote my second article. Its titled Concurrency in Java: The Dinning Philosopher's problem. Here's a link -


## March

- We had started C in alx. C is not fun
- Mostly ALX in march
- Oh, turned 20 on the 5th of march... 20 and still very broke.. LOL
- Oh and did I mention we're on strike, yeah ASUU problem again. so no school since like february...(LOL again I'm filling this in April)
- Started A Javascript course on freeCodeCamp
- (In the midst of all this, power supply fell out in Nigeria, so we had like extra irregular power supply, which slowed down my progress)
- 

## April

- Right now April, back to the present...ish

- Quit ALX....yeahhh I know, but it had to be done. At that point, felt like I was wasting my time. And now? ehnn I really don't know...let's just say I'm questioning my decision.

- So here are the reasons I quit ALX
    - first, those damn deadlines, really was tough to meet up to.. felt like I was suffocating
    - I also didn't feel like i was learning anything... C is a terrible language with all due respect
    - I had already done the things that they were teaching in Java at school, so felt like i was wasting my time, but they had a tempting curriculum that promised good stuff in future but there's a catch... it wasn't in my preferred language. It was python, yuck...maybe I'm still naive but I wasn't having any of it at that time.
    - Also, they didn't teach well at all. old and outdated resources.... they haven't changed their curriculum since 2016....mannn.
    - And lastly, I realised that I hate being caged.... if you're in ALX you really can't do anything else...no exploring or learning something on the side..nada. yes, it really was that time consuming. I didn't have time at all for the js course with FCC. In the end I chose js over ALX.

- So why am I questioning my decision
    - I'm no longer naive?? LOL, so yeah as a software engineer I should be able to pickup any lang without trouble...which I can btw (one of my biggest flex) but preferences mannn...guess I'm still naive LOL
    - Also having a curriculum is actually a good thing, just to put all the troubles of roadmaps into the curriculum's hands and go with the flow. But then, I would still like breathing space. Once you pick ALX it becomes your life and with their outdated resources I'm not sure I trust those hands
- So yeah enough ALX...or is it? eyes...LOL

- Fast forward, completed the freeCodeCamp js course... omo this one too was tough o..LOL. Felt like an idiot plenty times while attempting those questions.. Omo I dub o make I no lie.(Really need to practice more on my problem solving skills...LeetCode calling my name) but some questions I Kill them too o. O sha mo na
- Also, Js is a beautiful language. Despite the criticisms(which are very valid btw..LOL) I found it to be quite lovely especially es6..good stuff... infact java is looking more and more like es6 i noticed.

- The criticisms
    - Js has a horrible OOP...man that prototype thing is a joke. Ok maybe not a joke but the logic is quite twisty and weird. Compared to Java? yeah its a steep step down.
    - Js doesnt have types, so doing arithmetic with it can be quite worrisome....unpredicatble results in some cases.

- The Good sides
    - Js has a good fucntional programming paradigm going on for it. Honestly its like it was made for functional programming. I had a whole rave on this for like 2 weeks. I'm still nowhere with it..LOL. But I really like it and would love to do more with it.
    - Btw java also has functional programming being adapted to it too... you just gotta love java man.

- Started projects with Js: So the plan was to go straight to react after js..but I realised I really don't have much projects or articles with js... ikr impossible!!, I have at least 6 web projects by now?...LOL lies!!... The thing is until now I have used js as a mere ornament in my web projects..mainly to do things that seem far strectched out to do alone with css so I employed js to simple things out. But a js focused web project? NOPE haven't done one yet.

- so now I have started a project that involves APIs. its called "IP Tracker". It gets the location of a computer from its IP address and displays it on a map...pretty cool right? let's hope I compelete it in due time.

- And in conjunction, I have also commenced a course in react on scrimba...i know doing two things at the same time but omo no time no time abeg, gotta make this money and react is where the money is at.

- And as April ends today, one last thing, like a teaser or a bomb, see it as you will..LOL. But I'm torn between backend and frontend...let's discuss this further in May..
